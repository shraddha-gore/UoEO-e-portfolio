              e-Portfolio Activity: Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in Computing
              in the age of Generative AI
            </h4>
            <p>Read Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023).</p>
            <p>
              From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and
              there is no field of activity that has not been impacted in some
              way. This is so much truer for Computer Science, which is where it
              all began. It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is
              nothing new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field after the
              ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been slow but constant, today there is
              the need of a different set of rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Correa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that “a lot of
              work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should
              guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing
              a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of
              various stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative
              discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to
              catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the
              world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.”
            </p>
            <p>
              After reviewing the article and reading how different countries
              across the world deal with the generative AI revolution, discuss
              your views on the subject and recommend what you think could be a
              suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also
              reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant
              literature (additional links to industry have been provided as
              ‘Other Resources’ to the module). Your discussion should also
              highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal,
              social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right
              or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the
              legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect
              computing professionals in industry.

            <b>Response:</b>

            <div class="response">
              <p>
                Since late 2022, generative AI has been everywhere, from art
                studios to software labs, changing how we work and create. But
                AI ethics isn’t brand new. As Deckard (2023) points out, people
                have cared about fairness, openness and responsibility since the
                AI winter of the 1980s. What’s new is how fast and how far these
                models reach, so we need fresh ways to keep AI in check.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the past few years, dozens of guidelines and principles have
                popped up, all saying things like “AI should be fair” or “AI
                must be transparent.” Correa et al. (2023) looked at 200 of
                these documents and grouped them into 17 big ideas, think
                transparency, justice and reliability. The problem? Everyone
                defines these ideas a bit differently. One guide says
                transparency means “explaining why the AI did what it did,”
                while another wants “full access to data and code.” That makes
                it hard for teams to actually follow the rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                Different places focus on different ideas, too. Correa et al.
                (2023) found that North America and Europe stress transparency
                and reliability, but in Asia, there’s extra emphasis on
                beneficence, making sure AI helps people and avoids harm. EU
                rules highlight individual rights under GDPR, while China’s
                guidelines stress social harmony. Deckard (2023) reminds us that
                ethical AI must fit into real-world contexts and respect local
                values.
              </p>
              <p>
                IBM (n.d.) also highlights that trust in AI comes from embedding
                ethical principles at every stage of the AI lifecycle, from
                design to deployment, and making sure those principles are
                governed by both people and processes. Their approach includes
                fairness, explainability, robustness, transparency, and privacy,
                all of which help ensure AI is not just powerful, but also
                responsible.
              </p>
              <p>
                We need better tools and rules that everyone can use. First, we
                should build an easy-to-use hub, think a website, that gathers
                AI guidelines from around the world. Researchers could search by
                country, principle or type of rule. Correa et al. (2023) already
                made a prototype in Power BI and Dash, but we should expand it,
                include more languages and keep it updated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, AI changes fast, so our rules must adapt too. Inspired
                by how we regulate drugs or cybersecurity, we should test AI
                models regularly, not just at launch. Public–private
                partnerships could run these tests, checking fairness, safety
                and social impact on a rolling basis. Floridi and Cowls (2019)
                call this “reflexive governance,” where ethics guide every step
                of the AI lifecycle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, soft guidelines are nice, but companies must follow the
                rules they have been given. Governments in places like Canada,
                Germany and the UK (which already have some binding AI laws)
                should write core ethics principles into law. Imagine
                “algorithmic impact assessments” as mandatory checks or clear
                liability rules for AI harms. Professional bodies like BCS can
                help by certifying AI experts in ethics and making regular
                training a must.
              </p>
              <p>
                These steps would have clear effects. Legally, consistent
                definitions and real laws make it easier for companies to comply
                and for courts to resolve disputes, whether about bias or
                copyright. Socially, public reports on AI testing, like
                financial disclosures, let everyone see how safe, fair and
                transparent these systems are. Communities can hold developers
                accountable. Professionally, AI practitioners will need new
                skills in ethics, law and social science. Official
                certifications from BCS or similar bodies would recognise that
                expertise and encourage ongoing learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                To sum up, we don’t need to fear or ignore generative AI. With
                the right mix of open tools, flexible governance and binding
                rules, we can enjoy AI’s benefits while keeping it responsible
                and fair. After all, ethics is the solid ground that makes
                trustworthy AI possible.
